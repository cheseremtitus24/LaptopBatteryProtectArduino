# LaptopBatteryProtectArduino
Tired of having to replace your damaged battery due to overcharging caused damage. I tinkered around and came up with a python service that reads the battery percentage. When %age is at 100 it disengages the charger by turning off charging else at 4% it turns on charging. This is made possible through use of a relay.
